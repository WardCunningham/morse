/***	Cw.cxx - transmit CW on multimedia audio
 *
 *  Cw.cxx contains routines that send practice code using the "Simple
 *  DirectMedia Layer" (SDL, see http://www.libsdl.org).  This library
 *  purports to support similar operations on Linux, Windows, Mac, and
 *  several other platforms.  We shall see.
 *
 *  Basically, the modus operandi:
 *
 *    0. Catch signals which might cause us to exit ungracefully.
 *	  Make sure SDL_CloseAudio() and SDL_Quit() are called, in
 *	  that order, when we do exit gracefully.  Signal catching
 *	  should be done by the caller.  We'll register the two
 *	  SDL functions using "atexit()" here.
 *
 *    1. Call SDL_Init() to initialize the multimedia system.  The
 *        particular subset of features are selected by a bit mask.
 *	  we'll only need audio.  We don't need a Joystick; we won't
 *	  use accelerated graphics; we'll eschew CD audio and SDL's
 *	  media file parsing; etc, etc.
 *
 *    2. Call SDL_OpenAudio() to specify a) the format of waveform data
 *	  we'll be handing to SDL (16-bit native signed mono), and
 *	  b) a "callback" function capable of generating this data
 *	  and placing it into an arbitrary buffer, on demand from the
 *	  audio subsystem.
 *    
 *    3. Call SDL_PauseAudio(0) to get the ball rolling.
 *
 *  Here, we provide exactly three functions.  One function initializes SDL
 *  (if necessary) and sets the frequency, code speed and loudness for the
 *  subsequent "transmission".  Another accepts a single ASCII (or Uni-
 *  code since both are the same for all Morse characters) and emits the
 *  appropriate sounds on to the sound card.  A third simply returns the
 *  number of seconds since the last pending code element (dot, dash or
 *  space) was swallowed by the sound system.  This is useful for Ward's
 *  Morse machine to time the students response *after* she's heard the
 *  letter (instead of when it was sent). 
 *
 *  Somewhere in the ARRL Handbook is a formula that gives the WPM rate
 *  in terms of the dots/second or dots/minute, or somesuch.  However
 *  the Handbook has grown so large and cluttered, and the indexing so
 *  inadequate, that I cannot lay my eyes on it.  We'll have to rely on
 *  Google instead...
 *
 *  In, "The Art & Skill of Radio-Telegraphy", 2nd Ed, William Pierpont,
 *  (http://www.geocities.com/gm0rse/n0hff/c23.htm), N0HFF suggests there
 *  are "50 elements used as today's standard word".
 *
 *  Elsewhere, "PARIS" is frequently mentioned as the "standard word":
 *
 *    P = .--. = 1+1 + 3+1 + 3+1 + 1+3 = 14 elements
 *    A = .-   = 1+1 + 3+3	       =  8 elements
 *    R = .-.  = 1+1 + 3+1 + 1+3       = 10 elements  Total: 50 elements
 *    I = ..   = 1+1 + 1+3	       =  6 elements
 *    S = ...  = 1+1 + 1+1 + 1+7       = 12 elements
 *
 *  Thus, if unanimity is to be believed, the standard word has 50 elements,
 *  and the formula that I can't find in the Handbook is:
 *
 *	      WPM = (DPM*2)/50 = dpm/25, where DPM is dots per minute
 *
 *  (I vaguely remember "25" in the ARRL formula, so maybe this is right.)
 *
 *  For a code speed, WPM, we'll need an element time, E:
 *
 *		E = 60/(50*WPM) = N/f
 *
 *  Where f is the tone frequency, and N is the number of cycles of that tone.
 *  Thus:
 *		N = 1.2*f / WPM
 *
 *  BUG:  We wait in a thread by simply "while (...);".  There must be a
 *  way to relinquish the CPU than waiting to be hit on the head by a clock,
 *  but I can't figure it out.

/***  Character table - one bit for each "code element"

 *  Thus, we can embed letter spaces after the characters as well as before.

 *
 *  Thus, a dash, requires four bits, three with the key closed, and one
 *  to to separate it from its neighbor.  So characters of up to eight
 *  dashes may be accomodated.  I don't think even the new '@' requires
